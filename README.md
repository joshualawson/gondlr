# gondlr
*pronounced gondola -- a light flat-bottomed boat used on Venetian canals, having a high point at each end and worked by 
one oar at the stern.*

**WORK IN PROGRESS!** - Do not use this for production use, just yet!

A golang implementation of the Bundlr SDK and CLI

## TODO:
The current list of todo to get this aligned with the JS SKD/CLI

CLI Commands:

- [x] Balance
- [ ] Withdraw
- [ ] Upload
- [ ] Upload-dir
- [ ] Fund
- [x] Price

Supported Networks/Wallets/Signers:

- [x] Arweave
- [ ] Ethereum
- [ ] Solana
- [ ] Near
- [ ] ERC20

Misc:

- [ ] Mock Bundlr node
- [ ] Get unit tests up to scratch

Part of my mission while doing this is to create a swagger spec for Bundlr, as the API is currently not documented.
